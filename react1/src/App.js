            <p className='ans'>
              React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
              <ul>
                <li>Declarative - React makes it painless to create interactive UIs.</li>
                <li>Component Based - Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.</li>
                <li>Learn Once, Write Anywhere - React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.</li>

            <p className='ans'>
              NPM is short for node package manager, an online directory that contains the various already registered open-source packages.
              <br />
              It's a library and registry for JavaScript software packages. npm also has command-line tools to help you install the different packages and manage their dependencies.

            <p className='ans'>
              There are several reason which define the role of Node js in react JS-
              <br />
              <ol>
                <li>High server load - web application needs handling of multiple requests and maintaining server load balance.</li>
                <li>Real time data - If your applicationâ€™s core is based on Real-time Data-Intensive management or Data Streaming, Nodejs is highly advisable for continued server connection.</li>
                <li>JSON APIs - Building JSON APIs for your application is very efficient with Nodejs due to high code reusability and easy code sharing in Reactjs.</li>
                <li>Single Page Application(SPA) - Developing SPA in React while using Node to build a lightweight backend model for asynchronous data loading through callback functions.</li>
                <li>MERN Stack - Nodejs can also be used with React with MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Nodejs) stack.</li>

            <p className='ans'>
              CLI stands for Command Line Interface.
              <br />
              A CLI is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer.
              <br />
              Command-line interfaces are also called command-line user interfaces, console user interfaces and character user interfaces.

            <h2>5. What is Components in React Js?</h2>
            <p className='ans'>
              Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
              <br />
              A Component is one of the core building blocks of React. In other words, we can say that every application you will develop in React will be made up of pieces called components. Components make the task of building UIs much easier.
              <br />
              Components come in two types
              <br />
              (1) Function components - Functional components are simply javascript functions.
              <br />
              (2) Class components - The class components are a little more complex than the functional components.

                <li>Header Component - Headers are compositions that extend standard navbar functionalites. They contain additional components like jumbotron, sub-navbar, or image covers which serve as a containers for extra navigation elements - usually links, forms, or call-to-action buttons.</li>
                <li>Content Component - Content Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

              A component is updated whenever there is change in component's state or props.
              <br />
              React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:
              <ol>
                <li>getDerivedStateFromProps()</li>
                <li>shouldComponentUpdate()</li>

                <li>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()</li>
                <li>componentDidUpdate()</li>
              </ol>
              The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.
